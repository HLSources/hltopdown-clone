**HLTopDown**

This is a small coding project I've been working on. The basic goal is to get Half-Life 1 fully playable as a top-down shooter.

It's a bit rough around the edges but it works better than I expected, and I plan to keep making improvements in the future.

If you want to install the mod now, it will work just like any other Half-Life mod.

**How to play**

First, download the repository if you haven't already (it's the button on the top right of the page with the cloud).

Then find your Half-Life folder. If you have trouble, go to it in your steam library, right click it, go to properties, local files, then browse local files.

Open the zip file and extract the folder "hltopdown-master" to your Half-Life directory. When you open the folder, it should have a bunch of files.

Restart steam, and you're good to go! (It should be called "Half-Life: Top-Down" in your library)

(Let me know if anything really bad happens. Occasional camera clipping is expected right now.)
